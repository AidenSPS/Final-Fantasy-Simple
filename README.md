# Final-Fantasy-Simple
A Final Fantasy Clone. Inspired by the original 1987 NES Classic. 

NOTE: This is a simple version, things such as party creation, graphics, Advanced User Interface and many more advanced features will not be added to this github repository. They will be added to a repository on my Github Profile named, "Final Fantasy Fancy" or "Fancy Fantasy". Will have the advanced version pinned to my Github Profile. 

This was created so that colleges that I apply to can take a look at what work that I have to offer and what skills that I have in Web Applications and in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Coding in General.
